excerpt: "Arnout Devos"

Hi, I'm Arnout, a PhD student in Computer Science at [EPFL](http://ic.epfl.ch) in Lausanne, Switzerland. My research interests include meta-learning, few-shot learning, and unsupervised representations.

Previously, I obtained my MS in CS at [USC](http://www.usc.edu), as a [BAEF](http://www.baef.be) fellow, and MS/BS in EECS at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).
In March 2017, I co-organized Belgium's largest [Student Startup Forum](https://arnoutdevos.github.io/Student-Startup-Forum-2017/).

Hi, I'm Arnout, a PhD student in Computer Science at [EPFL](http://ic.epfl.ch).

Previously, I obtained my MS in CS at [USC](http://www.usc.edu), as a [BAEF](http://www.baef.be) fellow, and MEng/BS in EECS at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).
In March 2017, I co-organized Belgium's largest [Student Startup Forum](https://arnoutdevos.github.io/Student-Startup-Forum-2017/).

:soon: On January 29, 2018, I will give a talk at the [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://www.appliedmldays.org/tracks/4).

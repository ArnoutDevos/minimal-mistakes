Back in 2013, together with Jeroen Gillis, I made a sumo robot with which we competed in the 'national' finals at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en). We finished 6th out of 44 teams, as the best KU Leuven team, and it was a lot of fun! A key factor to our robot being among the best was it's mirror coating, confusing enemy infrared-based distance sensors.

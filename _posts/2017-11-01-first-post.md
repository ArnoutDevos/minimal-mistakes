Three goals for week 10:

- Interpolation and resampling of CMU Motion Capture Data to get framerate of choice
- Add MuJoCo functionality to the Docker
- Learn a walking policy for the CMU Mocap skeleton with a state-of-the-art baselines RL algorithm (PPO)
- Understand GAIL paper
- Find workaround to run Docker with MuJoCo and Roboschool on OSX

My name is Arnout and I am an MS CS student at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu) (USC) where I am being advised by [Gaurav Sukathme](http://robotics.usc.edu/~gaurav/) on [reinforcement learning research](https://uscresl.github.io/humanoid-gail/). At USC, I am funded by a [Belgian American Educational Foundation (BAEF)](http://www.baef.be) research fellowship.

Previously I've obtained my master's in EE and Management from [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be) (Belgium). With [Bart Baesens](https://feb.kuleuven.be/Bart.Baesens) I have worked on profit-driven machine learning models for credit scoring and in [Patrick Reynaert](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~reynaert/)'s lab I've done work on [the future of 5G telecommunication circuits](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/555554/1/NORCAS_Arnout.pdf). During my internship at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch/) (Switzerland) I have worked with [Catherine Dehollain](https://personnes.epfl.ch/catherine.dehollain) on low-power transmitters for neural implants.

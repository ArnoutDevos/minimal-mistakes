Over the years, I've had many interesting opportunities to perform (independent) research. Currently my field of interest is Machine Learning, whereas previously I did some work in Micro- and Nanoelectronics.

### Multiphase 34 GHz Oscillator for 5G
5G telecommunication hardware will make use of beamforming transceivers for high frequency (> 30 GHz) carriers. This creates a need for efficient multiphase frequency generators. I designed a digitally controlled multiphase oscillator in 90nm CMOS for this purpose, exploiting a distributed architecture, which had a better than state-of-the-art figure of merit in accurate simulation.

### Low-Power Low-Area Transmitter for Neural Implants
When measuring neural brain signals, implantable devices require a battery which is often too big or low-power designs require a lot of chip area resulting in a very expensive product. I co-designed a low-power low-area transmitter enabling for more accurate and comfortable neural signal measurements.

Reference: coming soon, work with Catherine Dehollain and Kerim Ture.

### Photosensitivity of Silicon Junctionless FETs
Due to aggressive downscaling of conventional silicon MOSFET transistors problems arise between different doping regions known as short channel effects. As a side-effect of this scaling new devices such as the junctionless transistor (JLT) become functional. In simulation, I analyzed the photosensitivity features of this emerging device.
